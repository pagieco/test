# Application Frame

The application-frame component, while not visible in the user interface itself, provides the structure for the 
application. It wraps the main elements and houses the primary navigation, top-bar and toast components.

## Best practices

For the best experience when creating an application-frame, use the following components:

- [Top Bar](/components/top-bar.html)
- [Navigation](/components/navigation.html)
- [Toast](/components/toast.html)
